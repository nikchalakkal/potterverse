Exploring the relationships between various characters in the Harry Potter Universe

The Harry Potter series has been a resounding success both as books and movies, and one of the essential parts of this magical world is how J.K Rowling vividly depicts each character with various background settings and personality designs. In her writings, different beasts can communicate in fantastic ways, wizards and muggles are bonded by blood, and a vast magical network is growing and even integrated into the real world.

As a part of this project, we explore the interpersonal relationships between the major characters. By doing so, we are hoping to achieve two goals:
1. Explain why specific plots and relationships develop that way.
2. Explore what groups or clusters the characters truly stand for.

Aside from the information from the books and movies, we will try and understand this complex network through social network analysis. We are hoping to gain some insights from an analytical point of view, to see how our results differ from traditional story plots. 

If you havenâ€™t read the books or watched the movies, please note that there are spoilers ahead!
